Description: A tool for assessing bio-economic feedback in 
  different management scenarios. smartR (Spatial Management and Assessment of demersal Resources for 
  Trawl fisheries in R) combines information from different 
  tasks gathered within the European Data Collection Framework for the fishery
  sector. The smartR package implements the SMART model in R, through the 
  object-oriented programming paradigm, and within this package it is possible
  to achieve the complete set of analyses required by the SMART approach: 
  from the editing and formatting of the raw data; the construction and 
  maintenance of coherent datasets; the numerical and visual inspection of 
  the generated metadata; to the final simulation of management scenarios and
  the forecast of their effects. The interaction between the user and the 
  application could take place through invocation of methods via the command
  line or could be entirely committed to the graphical user interfaces (GUI).
