Description: SMART (Spatial MAnagement of demersal Resources for Trawl
    fisheries), a tool for assessing bio-economic feedback in different management
    scenarios. SMART combines information from different tasks gathered within
    the European Data Collection Framework on fisheries and is composed of: 1)
    spatial models of fishing effort, environmental characteristics and distribution
    of demersal resources; 2) an Artificial Neural Network which captures the
    relationships among these aspects in a spatially explicit way and uses them
    to predict resources abundances; 3) a deterministic module which analyzes the
    size structure of catches and the associated revenues, according to different
    spatially-based management scenarios.
