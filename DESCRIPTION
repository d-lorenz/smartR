Description: A tool for assessing bio-economic feedback in 
  different management scenarios (D'Andrea et al., 2020 
  <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13394>). 'smartR' (Spatial Management and Assessment 
  of demersal Resources for Trawl fisheries) combines information from different
   tasks gathered within the European Data Collection Framework for the fishery
  sector. The 'smartR' package implements the SMART model (Russo et al., 2014 
  <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086222>), through the object-oriented 
  programming paradigm, and within this package it is possible to achieve the 
  complete set of analyses required by the SMART approach: from the editing and
   formatting of the raw data; the construction and maintenance of coherent 
  datasets; the numerical and visual inspection of the generated metadata; to 
  the final simulation of management scenarios and the forecast of their 
  effects. The interaction between the user and the application could take 
  place through invocation of methods via the command line or could be entirely
   committed to the graphical user interfaces (GUI).
