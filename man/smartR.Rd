\title{Spatial Management and Assessment of demersal Resources for Trawl
fisheries in R}
\description{
smartR (Spatial Management and Assessment of demersal Resources for
Trawl fisheries in R), a tool for assessing bio-economic feedback in
different management scenarios. smartR combines information from different
tasks gathered within the European Data Collection Framework for the fishery
sector. The smartR package implements the SMART model in R, through the
object-oriented programming paradigm, and within this package it is possible
to achieve the complete set of analyses required by the SMART approach:
from the editing and formatting of the raw data; the construction and
maintenance of coherent datasets; the numerical and visual inspection of
the generated metadata; to the final simulation of management scenarios and
the forecast of their effects. The interaction between the user and the
application could take place through invocation of methods via the command
line or could be entirely committed to the graphical user interfaces (GUI).

\section{Start Here}{

Here are listed the most important elements of a Smart analysis. The first
is the GUI developed to guide and assist the user, while the other five are
the classes that make up the smartR package.
